Handwriting Text Recognition Project

I developed this project using cnn algorithm. I used the MNIST dataset and the A-Z dataset.
Step 1: Read the full details I mention here.
Step 2: Download the code files I uploaded to Git Hub.
Step 3: First train the train.py file in Pycharm ide.
Step 4: If training is completed then run the app.py file to process the output.
Step 5: Then the canvas window will appear to input the digit or character data.
Step 6: Then click the run button to predict the accuracy.
Step 7: Finally it shows the result with voice recognition also shows the accuracy.

Thank you...
